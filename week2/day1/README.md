## Insturctions:

### We got a chance to run through the [Lab 1](./exploratory-analysis-and-feature-engineering.ipynb) and [Lab 2](./sagemaker-processing) during the session. But feel free to run through them again to understand any concepts that you did not understand during the session.

## HOME WORK:

 [Lab 3](ai-ml-bb/week2/day1/autopilot.ipynb)

* Additonal Challenge: After the first run and understanding the concepts, please modify the notebook such that it only creates the candidate generation notebook only. Then use the notebooks to run the actual training and tuning process. Hint: search for GenerateCandidateDefinitionsOnly [here](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.create_auto_ml_job)

Optional [PCA Lab](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/f0a137dab6397d6e5649dc780f8278cfade4a7dc/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/pca_mnist/pca_mnist.ipynb)

    Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.
